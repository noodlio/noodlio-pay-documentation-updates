# Upgrading to Noodlio Pay 

In this repository, you will find documentation on how to upgrade to [Noodlio Pay](https://market.mashape.com/noodlio/noodlio-pay-smooth-payments-with-stripe)

Noodlio Pay is an easy, straightforward solution for accepting payments on your website, in your app, or elsewhere on the web. Thanks to the REST setup, your application can immediately start making requests to the API, which validates input and charges your clients for their purchases. As we are using Stripe, all funds will immediately be transferred to your account.

Essentially, Noodlio Pay replaces your server-side, saving you the time to learn a new server language, test, validate and so on the server-side for your payments. In other words, it's hassle-free payment!
